# Trace-boundary-of-symmetric-object-in-image-with-uniform-background
Given image of symmetric object, the program found the boundary of the object
Given image of symmetric object in relatively uniform background the program found and mark the boundary of the object in the image. This code were initially made for glass and transparent liquid vessels in chemistry lab, but could applied to other images of symmetric object in uniform background. Note that the image is resized during the scan. 
Automatic mode will recognise the best boundary for the object in the image according to symmetry consideration (no user intervention required). 
Manual mode will create various of possible boundaries for the object in the image and will ask user to manually choose the best one.
